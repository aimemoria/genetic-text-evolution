-- Troubleshooting guide

## Why This Problem?

The activity focuses on evolving random text into Shakespeare quotes because it perfectly demonstrates GA advantages:

**The Challenge:**
- Target phrase "TO BE OR NOT TO BE" has 27^18 ~= 7.6 x 10^25 possible combinations
- Brute force at 1 billion attempts/second: ~2.4 billion years
- Genetic algorithm: Typically solves in <1000 generations (seconds)

**Why GAs Excel:**
- Massive search space makes exhaustive search impossible
- Simple fitness function (character matching)
- Population diversity explores multiple solutions simultaneously
- Evolutionary pressure converges on optimal solution
- No domain-specific knowledge required

## Quick Start

   npm start
   ```
   Open http://localhost:3000

3. **Share with your team:**
   - Provide link to this repository
   - Direct them to STUDENT-INSTRUCTIONS.md
   - Set implementation deadline

### For Students

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd AIT-204-genetic-alg
   ```

## Usage Flow

### Session 1: Introduction (60 minutes)
1. Present genetic algorithm concepts using the HTML handout (20 min)
2. Demo the interactive browser evolution (10 min)
3. Show the completed React application (10 min)
4. Explain the activity requirements (10 min)
5. Students begin setup and Part 1 (10 min)

### Session 2-3: Implementation (120 minutes)
Users can work through Parts 2-6 of STUDENT-INSTRUCTIONS.md:
- Implement Individual class
- Build GeneticAlgorithm class
- Create React components
- Add styling
- Test functionality

### Session 4: Deployment & Extensions (60 minutes)
- Deploy to Vercel or Render.com (20 min)
- Work on extension challenges (30 min)
- Prepare submission report (10 min)

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Vercel (Recommended)
```bash
cd shakespeare-ga
npm install -g vercel
vercel --prod
```

### Option 2: Render.com
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Connect repository at https://render.com
3. Configure as Static Site:
   - Build: `npm install && npm run build`
   - Publish: `build`

### Option 3: GitHub Pages
```bash
cd shakespeare-ga
npm install gh-pages --save-dev
npm run build
npx gh-pages -d build
```

## Genetic Algorithm Parameters

Students can experiment with:
- **Population Size:** 50-500 (default: 200)
- **Mutation Rate:** 0-10% (default: 1%)
- **Crossover Rate:** 0-100% (default: 80%)
- **Elitism Count:** 0-10 (default: 2)
- **Tournament Size:** Fixed at 5

## Expected Results

Typical performance for "TO BE OR NOT TO BE":
- Population 100, Mutation 1%: ~300-500 generations
- Population 200, Mutation 1%: ~200-400 generations
- Population 500, Mutation 1%: ~150-300 generations

Lower mutation rates converge faster but may get stuck.
Higher mutation rates maintain diversity but converge slower.

## Customization Ideas

### For Instructors:
1. Add more Shakespeare quotes
2. Include difficulty ratings for phrases
3. Create competition leaderboard
4. Add performance benchmarks

### For Students (Extensions):
1. Implement different selection methods (roulette wheel, rank-based)
2. Add two-point or uniform crossover
3. Implement adaptive mutation rates
4. Create parallel populations with migration
5. Add sound effects and animations
6. Export evolution statistics to CSV

## Assessment Rubric

| Criterion | Points | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Functionality | 40 | GA correctly evolves text to target |
| Code Quality | 25 | Well-organized, documented, follows best practices |
| UI/UX | 20 | Intuitive interface, visual appeal, responsiveness |
| Deployment | 10 | Successfully deployed and accessible |
| Report | 5 | Quality of analysis and insights |
| **Total** | **100** | |

## Troubleshooting

**Issue:** Evolution gets stuck at 90% fitness
**Solution:** Increase mutation rate slightly (1.5-2%)

**Issue:** Evolution is too slow
**Solution:** Reduce population size or increase elitism count

**Issue:** Module not found errors
**Solution:** Ensure all import paths use correct casing and file extensions

**Issue:** Deployment build fails
**Solution:** Check that all dependencies are in package.json, run `npm run build` locally first
